# Copilot Agent Prompt for Facilegestire Project

## Context
You are an AI coding assistant working on the FacileGestire 2.0 project, a multi-tenant real estate management application. The project is built using Laravel 12 with PHP 8.2+ for the backend and React 19 with TypeScript and Vite for the frontend. The application employs a modular design and utilizes Stancl/Tenancy for multi-tenancy, Laravel Passport for authentication, and Material-UI for the UI components.
